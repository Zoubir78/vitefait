# vite fait et bien fait
Small craftsman website

This is an autonomous project for our intern. 
## General task 
Take the idea of an existing website and create a modern version. 
Provided are pictures, texts, main colors. 

## Tasks 
- define the means* to create the website (language, framework)
- define a modern visual identity for a craftsman
- create the structure
- create the pages
- test it toroughly
- upload steps once weekly
- deploy when ready**

* As this is not a fully commercial project but has a training purpose, 
the means can be "overkill" for the result. 
It should be rather fast though. 
** the project should replace the existing website, link to follow
